The statistics group meeting is an initiative for the members of the Leiden University statistics group to keep up with each other's research. We strive to have
biweekly gatherings at the Snellius, during which one of the members will present their work. After the presentation, there should be plenty of time
for discussion. In the days leading up to a meeting, there will be a post on the [home page]({{ site.url }}) with an abstract of the talk and other relevant 
details (time, room, etc.).

## Schedule
