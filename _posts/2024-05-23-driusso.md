Throughout the years, several statistical models have been developed to describe interactions between individuals. These relational data are typically represented as a graph, where vertices correspond to the individuals, and two vertices are joined by an edge if there is a relationship among them. However, in some real-world situations, relationships may involve groups of individuals rather than just pairs. To represent such phenomena, an extension of graphs, called hypergraphs, can be utilized. Furthermore, relational data often evolve over time, but existing statistical methods for hypergraphs usually ignore this temporal information. To describe the evolution of hypergraphs over time, we propose a survival generalization of the Latent Class Analysis (LCA) approach for static hypergraphs. The proposed model is a mixture of Cox regression models for recurrent events. The model parameters are estimated via the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. This model represents the first attempt to model dynamic hypergraphs using a model-based clustering approach. Additionally, the proposed method has the potential to be the basis for future extensions and alternative modelling approaches, which will be briefly discussed.
