title: Vertical models in the presence of random effects (Salvatore Battaglia). 
---

The seventh installment of the statistics group meeting will take place on Tuesday 11/10 from 12:00 to 13:00 in Snellius 176. 
During this meeting, guest speaker Salvatore Battaglia will present the results of the research he performed during six fruitful months at the MI:

<em>
" The vertical model is an alternative to competing risks model, in particular when the proportionality
assumption is relaxed or in presence of missing cause of failure. The novelty is to accomodate for a random
component, one for each part of the model, in order to take into account the unobserved heterogeneity
in presence of clusters. The data used come from the EMUR database, a database including Emergency
Department's (ED) accesses coming from 63 sicilian EDs. The vertical model will be able to compute the risk
of being discharge or hospitalized once admitted inside the ED including a random centre effect. 
According to the value of correlation coefficient among the couple of random effects (Ui, Vi) two types of 
vertical model are computed: the separated one when no correlation is supposed, the joint vertical model in 
the other case. Due to large computational times recorded in the separated vertical model under a frequentist
approach, we decided to use R-INLA package to perform a joint vertical model analysis under a 
Bayesian framework."
