title: "When exactly? Two overlooked  biases in SARS-CoV-2 incubation time estimation related to information regarding exposure (Vera Arntzen)"
---

The seventeenth statistics group meeting will take place on 13/06 from 12:00-13:00 in Snellius 176.
Vera Arntzen will update us on the research she has been doing since her talk last year.

<em>
Exposure information is essential for estimating the incubation time of an infectious disease (infection to symptom onset) and is typically interval censored. Interval censored time origins complicate analysis. For SARS-CoV-2, data on exposure has been collected retrospectively, mostly by interviewing detected cases. However, our memory is imperfect, with recent exposures being more precisely recalled than older ones, leading to differential recall. Interval censored observations with less precise exposures are often excluded from analysis. This creates bias, because longer incubation times are more likely to be excluded.

Another bias in the initial estimates of SARS-CoV-2 incubation time arises from data collected from travellers from Wuhan. Only individuals who developed symptoms after departure were included, resulting in an underrepresentation of cases with short incubation times (left truncation).

Differential recall and left truncation in this context have been consistently overlooked. In this presentation, we shed light on these sources of bias and examine their impact on estimates of incubation time using simulations.
