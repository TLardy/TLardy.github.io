The Dirichlet Process (DP) is widely used in Bayesian non-parametrics, particularly in Dirichlet Process mixture models because of its flexibility and computational simplicity. The Dirichlet Process Gaussian mixture model (DP-GMM) is a limiting case of the finite Gaussian mixture model. This talk reviews DP-GMM and presents an extension of this model which accommodates covariates for multivariate density estimation and clustering problems. Emphasis is given to the main features of the DP mixture models, both with and without covariate information. Applications on real clinical data concerning prostate cancer are carried out using this methodology as an aim to construct an improved analytical tool for prostate cancer detection. Other relevant patient outcomes such as benign prostatic hyperplasia have also been considered.
