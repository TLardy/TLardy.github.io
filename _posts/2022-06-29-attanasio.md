title: Can statistics be helpful in detecting electoral fraud?
---

This talk will be given by Massimo Attanasio from the University of Palermo:

<em>
" In Italy, the Senate and the Chambers of Deputies include 18 representatives elected by the Italians living abroad. The elections for the Italians living abroad are processed by mail and the ballots are collected by the Italian consulates all over the world. The arrival of the ballots at each consulate is done collecting a certain amount of ballots into boxes, then signed and sealed. In 2018, Fabio Porta - candidate of the Democratic Party in the South America district - sued Adriano Cairo of fraudulent use of absentee ballots, claiming the manipulation of some of the boxes coming from Buenos Aires.  In 2022, after a long civil trial, Adriano Cairo was removed from office and Fabio Porta was nominated Senate member. This work deals with the statistical analysis aiming at proving from a probabilistic point of view how “unlikely” was the distribution of the ballots into the boxes in the Buenos Aires district."
