title:  Anytime-Valid Tests of Conditional Independence Under Model-X (Tyron Lardy)
---

The twelfth statistics group meeting will take place on 21/02 from 12:00-13:00 in Snellius 176. I (Tyron Lardy) will present some of the work I have been doing since the start of my PhD.

<em>
"I will present a sequential, anytime-valid method to test conditional independence of a response Y and a predictor X given a random vector Z. This test is based on e-statistics and test martingales, which generalize likelihood ratios and allow valid inference at arbitrary stopping times. In accordance with the recently introduced model-X setting, it is contingent on knowledge of the conditional distribution of X given Z, or at least a sufficiently sharp approximation thereof. We will discuss robustness with respect to misspecification of this conditional distribution and show how our test compares to non-sequential tests in a simulation study."
