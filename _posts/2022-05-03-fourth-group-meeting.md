title: Uncertainty quantification using Gaussian Process with squared exponential kernel (Amine Hadji, MSc)
---

The fourth statistics group meeting will be held on Tuesday 10/05 from 13.00 to 14.00 in Snellius 402.
The speaker for this meeting is Amine Hadji.
Amine started his PhD at Leiden University in 2016, focussing mainly on the theoretical study of Bayesian non-parametric methods.
He has currently taken on a role as lecturer, while finishing his PhD. His talk will give us a glimpse of the research he has been doing:

<em>
“Gaussian processes are widely used in various fields of applications. Arguably, one of the most popular and frequently used covariance kernel is the squared exponential kernel. As typical draws from the corresponding Gaussian process have too smooth sample paths, it is common to rescale the kernel. For optimal rescaling one applies in practice empirical or hierarchical Bayes methods. The theoretical literature focuses mainly on the recovery of the underlying functional parameter of interest in context of nonparametric regression and classification and derives (nearly) optimal posterior contraction rates. We investigate the coverage properties of the corresponding credible sets in context of the Gaussian white noise model (which is closely related to the above models). We show that the resulting posterior distribution is not suitable for uncertainty quantification as the credible sets will have coverage tending to zero for typical signals. On the other hand, blowing the radius of our credible set by a log n factor or tuning the rescaling parameter allows the rescaled Gaussian process to encompass the truth.. The derived theoretical findings are demonstrated on a thorough simulation study, where amongst others we obtain that Gaussian processes with squared exponential kernel have substantially worse coverage properties than Gaussian processes with Matern kernel (for instance) in context of nonparametric regression and classification.”
