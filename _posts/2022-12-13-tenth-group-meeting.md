title: "Wasserstein-based soft clustering of functional covariances (Valentina Masarotto)" 
---

The tenth statistics group meeting will take place on Tuesday Dec. 13th from 12:30-13:30 in Snellius 176. 
During this meeting, Valentina Masarotto will present the work she has done on the clustering of functional data:

<em>
"In this talk, we consider the problem of clustering functional data according to their covariance structure. Although functional clustering is a topic widely studied in literature, very little still exists on clustering and classification of covariance operators. I will present a penalised clustering methodology that harnesses its power from the field of optimal transport, and that instead of performing hard clustering, allows operators to be partially classified in several groups at once. This soft classification arises naturally in settings where separation between some or all clusters is not well defined, and some overlapping between groups is admissible, or even preferable. A real case study is presented as an application at the end of the talk."
