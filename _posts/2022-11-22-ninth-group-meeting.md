title: "Dynamic predictions for early detection of ICU acquired infections (ICU-AI). (Cristian Spitoni)" 
---

The ninth statistics group meeting will take place on Tuesday Nov. 22nd from 12:30-13:30 in Snellius 176. 
We will be joined by guest speaker Cristian Spitoni from the Utrecht University:  

<em>
"The major cause of mortality in the ICU (Intensive Care Unit) is represented by secondary infections. Therefore, I will discuss the possibility of using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in order to predict the clinical onset of ICU-AI. The ANN is trained with high frequency time-series of vital signals (e.g. Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, Breath Rate and SaO_2), obtained from electronic health records (EHR).
</em>

<em>
However, we are not interested in a 'black-box'  prediction tool: in this talk I will illustrate indeed  the development of an interpretable  two-step prediction model, combining methodologies from statistical inference for stochastic processes and deep learning analysis of EHR.
</em>

<em>
In the first step we have designed indeed  a 1-D Convolutional Neural Network for extracting a risk score for the clinical onset of ICU-AI, based on the analysis of the high-frequency vital signals.  Then, in the second step we have used a Competing Risks Landmark model  with low-frequency time-dependent patient's history (e.g., baseline characteristics, daily measurements) and high-frequency information, summarized by the risk-score obtained in the first step.
</em>

<em>
Finally, I will focus on the interpretation of the extra predictive power by inverting the ANNs via saliency maps."
