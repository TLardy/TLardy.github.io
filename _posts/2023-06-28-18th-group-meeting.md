title:  "Predicting sub-types of ductal carcinoma in
situ using whole-slide images:
A deep learning approach (Raf Cruyff)"
---

The eighteenth statistics group meeting will take place on 28/06 from 12:00-13:00 in Snellius 176.
Raf Cruyff will tell us about the research he has been doing for his master's thesis. 

<em>
Accurate classification of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) subtypes is crucial
for treatment decisions, prognostic predictions, and clarifying the mecha-
nisms underlying the progression of DCIS to invasive breast cancer. In this
study, we propose a deep learning approach for subtype classification of DCIS.
Our approach leverages pretrained feature encoders on whole-slide im-
age tiles to extract informative features from histopathological data.
We explore two classification methods within our deep learning framework.
The first method employs an attention-based Multiple Instance Learning
approach, enabling the model to focus on the most relevant tiles for
subtype classification and enhancing prediction interpretability. The second
method involves reconstructing a feature map for convolutional neural net-
work prediction, preserving crucial spatial information during feature
extraction.
By developing an accurate classification model, we aim to provide valuable
insights into the progression mechanisms underlying different subtypes of
DCIS. Through extensive experimentation and evaluation on diverse DCIS
datasets, our deep learning approach holds promise for improved subtype
classification and a deeper understanding of DCIS progression
