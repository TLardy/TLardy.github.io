title: Does taking additional Maths classes in high school affect academic outcomes?
---

This talk will be given by Martina Vittorietti from the University of Palermo:

<em>
"Several studies in the mathematical education literature show the effect of studentsâ€™ skills in maths on their success at higher levels of education. In particular, the importance of maths course taking in US high schools is highlighted for college enrolment and completion. The choice of taking additional maths courses or, as in Italy, of choosing a high-school curriculum with more maths, is not random and it depends on several factors such as gender and socio-economic status. This selection bias implies that the differences on the academic outcomes might be traceable not only to mathematics ability and knowledge. In this talk, the aim is estimating the treatment effect of attending a relatively new high school curriculum with more maths, with respect to the traditional scientific one, on two academic outcomes of the Italian students: university enrolment and first-year university performance. A caliper multilevel propensity score matching procedure is proposed to eliminate the confounding effects."
