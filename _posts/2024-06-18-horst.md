<em>
Missing data arises in many data sets. Common imputation methods, such as the Multivariate Imputations by Chained Equations (MICE) and the multiple imputation by Substantive Model Compatible Fully Conditional Specification (SMC-FCS), have been worked out and analyzed for various settings, including competing risk analysis and traditional survival processes. In this talk, we will discuss the implementation for multi-state models, specifically the illness-death model, and compare different methods.
