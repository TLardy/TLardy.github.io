<em>
In recent years, the analysis of longitudinal (social) network data using Stochastic Actor-Oriented Models (SAOMs) has become increasingly popular across a variety of domains.
SAOMs offer insight into the dynamics that drive network evolution by modelling multiple, discrete observations of sociocentric network data as coming from a continuous-time Markov chain.
However, as with all survey-based data, social network data are susceptible to measurement errors, which may bias the parameter estimates.
This talk presents a simulation study that assesses the effects of measurement errors on the results of Stochastic Actor-Oriented Models.
Both randomly introduced measurement errors and systematically introduced measurement error informed by social and cognitive sciences are considered.
