<em>
Panel data arises when transitions between different states are interval-censored in multi-state data.
The analysis of such data using non-parametric multi-state models was not possible until recently, but is very desirable as it allows for more flexibility than its parametric counterparts.
The single available result to date has some unique drawbacks.
We propose a non-parametric estimator of the transition intensities for panel data using an Expectation Maximisation algorithm.
The method allows for a mix of interval-censored and right-censored (exactly observed) transitions.
A condition to check for the convergence of the algorithm to the non-parametric maximum likelihood estimator is given.
A simulation study comparing the proposed estimator to a consistent estimator is performed, and shown to yield near identical estimates at smaller computational cost.
A data set on the emergence of teeth in children is analysed. Code to perform the analyses is publicly available.
