The sixth statistics group meeting (or meetings) is a special one, due to all the guests we are honored to receive at the MI in July. There will be 
two blocks of three presentations: one on Tuesday 05/07 and one on Thursday 07/07 (both) in room 401 from 14:00-17:00. The abstracts will be uploaded separately.
