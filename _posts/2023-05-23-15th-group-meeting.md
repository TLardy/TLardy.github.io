title: "Identifiability aspects of the cure model in the presence of competing risks (Tijn Jacobs)"
---

The fifteenth statistics group meeting will take place on 23/05 from 12:00-13:00 in Snellius 176.
Tijn Jacobs will tell us about the research he has done as part of his master's programme.

<em>
In standard survival analysis each patient is assumed to experience the event of interest. Due to improved treatment, this assumption is not always realistic as many diseases show high survival rates. For example, many patients with cancer can be long-term survivors of their disease. The cure model allows for a fraction of the patients to be cured. That is, they never experience the event of interest. In the presence of competing risks, this notion of cure is not properly defined. We will look at different perspectives on cure in the presence of competing risks and introduce a model that allows for patients to be cured for multiple competing events. Special attention will be paid to the problem of identifiability for the cure model with and without competing risks.
