We introduce a procedure to address the invaluable problem of detecting and locating structural breaks in the covariance of functional data. The proposed method leverages the fact that the space of covariance operators can be identified with the space of centered Gaussian processes, lending access to optimal transport theory. We apply the method to detect structural breaks in the covariance of a sample of functional data by implementing a 2-sample test for the equality of the sample covariance operators of the first k and last n-k observations. In order to estimate the location of the change-point we work directly with the optimal transport maps between centered Gaussian processes. Simulation studies show the effectiveness of the procedure and we present two applications of our procedure on intraday return curves of oil futures and on phoneme log-periodiograms.
