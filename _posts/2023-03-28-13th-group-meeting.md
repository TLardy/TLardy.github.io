title: The built-in selection bias of hazard ratios formalized (Richard Post)
---

The thirteenth statistics group meeting will take place on 28/03 from 12:00-13:00 in Snellius 176.
We will be joined by guest speaker Richard Post from the department of Mathematics & Computer Science, TU Eindhoven.

<em>
"It is known that the causal interpretation of a hazard ratio is complicated. Even for data from a randomized controlled trial, the hazard ratio suffers from built-in selection bias as, over time, the individuals at risk in the exposed and unexposed are no longer exchangeable. In this work, we formalize how the observed hazard ratio evolves and deviates from the causal effect of interest in the presence of heterogeneity of the hazard rate of unexposed individuals (frailty) and heterogeneity in effect (individual modification). For the case of effect heterogeneity, we define the causal hazard ratio. We show that the expected observed hazard ratio equals the ratio of expectations of the latent variables (frailty and modifier) conditionally on survival in the world with and without exposure, respectively. Examples with gamma, inverse Gaussian and compound Poisson distributed frailty and categorical (harming, beneficial or neutral) distributed effect modifiers are presented for illustration. This set of examples shows that an observed hazard ratio with a particular value can arise for all values of the causal hazard ratio."
