<em>
When using multiple imputation (MI) to deal with missing covariates, a central consideration is that the imputation model and substantive model be compatible with each other (i.e. that they do not make conflicting assumptions). In the context of proportional hazards models in competing risks settings, a directly specified imputation model is generally only approximately compatible with the substantive model. In this talk, I will introduce various MI approaches for both cause-specific Cox models and the Fine–Gray model, and discuss how they perform based on simulation studies. I will also briefly touch upon how the development of a substantive model compatible imputation approach when using the Fine–Gray model provides insights into broader model misspecification issues in competing risks settings.
