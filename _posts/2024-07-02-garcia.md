A common question of causal nature in survival analysis is: Does a certain treatment have an effect on survival? Clinicians usually fit a Cox model, compute an estimated hazard ratio, and make their decisions based on this number alone. In the recent years, it has been shown that this is not enough to answer such a causal question, and the causal interpretation of this quantity has been a source of debate. An important issue is the time varying nature of the causal effect, which shows in a built-in survivor bias. This means that, even if treatment and control groups are similar at the beginning of the trial, the effect of treatment will make both groups more and more different as time goes on. There have been several solutions proposed, but we are going to choose one that defines a new causal version of the hazard ratio, that is not identifiable from data but gives a clear causal interpretation. From there, we will create a more general framework where tight bounds can be found for this quantity. We conclude with a practical example in vaccine efficacy, with a malaria and hiv vaccine trials data.
