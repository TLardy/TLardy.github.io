Enhancing research reproducibility and data accessibility is
essential in scientific research. However, ensuring data privacy while
achieving these goals is a challenging task, especially in the medical
field where sensitive data are often commonplace. One solution is to
use synthetic data that mimic real-world datasets. This method has the
potential to streamline therapy evaluation and facilitate quicker access
to innovative treatments.
We propose an approach that uses sequential conditional regression and
flexible parametric survival models to accurately replicate covariate patterns
and survival times. The approach is easily implementable through
an R function. We also provide an application to an onco-hematological
trial. The results show the potentialities of the proposed method in mirroring
original distributions and survival outcomes.
