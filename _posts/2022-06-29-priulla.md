title: Gender differences in Italian university students’ paths up to the master’s degree enrolment
---

This talk will be given by Andrea Priulla from the University of Palermo:

<em>
"In this work, the aim is to investigate the gender differences in the university students' paths in Italy, starting from the first enrolment up to the bachelor's degree completion, and the eventual master's degree enrolment. It is known from the literature that females are better in terms of dropout rates, bachelor's completion rates, and final grades. However, little has been done to analyze the persistence up to the master's level, because of the unavailability of such data. We will use a baseline-category logistic model to shed light on the factors most affecting students' decisions during their university careers. Results show that factors related to the high school career and to the decisions made in the first academic years have a strong influence on university persistence up to higher levels of education. The analysis concerns freshmen enrolled in 3-year degree courses in Italian universities from 2008 to 2014. Data are provided by the Italian Ministry of University and Research (MUR)."
