title: "Dynamic prediction of survival using multivariate Functional Principal Component Analysis: a strict landmarking approach (Daniel Gomon)"
---

The fourteenth statistics group meeting will take place on 18/04 from 12:00-13:00 in Snellius 176.
Our very own Daniel Gomon will update us on the research he has been doing since he last spoke at the group meeting.

<em>
"Dynamically predicting patient survival probabilities using longitudinal measurements has become of great importance with routine data collection becoming more common. Many existing models utilise a multi-step landmarking approach for this problem, mostly due to its ease of use and versatility but unfortunately most fail to do so appropriately. In this article we make use of multivariate functional principal component analysis (mFPCA) to summarise the available longitudinal information, and employ a Cox proportional hazards model for prediction. Additionally, we consider a centered FPCA procedure in an attempt to remove the natural variation incurred by the difference in age of the considered subjects. We formalize the difference between a 'relaxed' landmarking approach where only validation data is landmarked and a 'strict' landmarking approach where both the training and validation data are landmarked. We show that a relaxed landmarking approach fails to effectively use the information contained in the longitudinal outcomes, thereby producing substantially worse prediction accuracy than a strict landmarking approach."
