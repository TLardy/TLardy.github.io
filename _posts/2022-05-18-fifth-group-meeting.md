title: Distributed Gaussian processes for nonparametric regression and classification (I-Fan Lin, BSc)
---

The fifth statistics group meeting will be held on Tuesday 24/05 from 13.00 to 14.00 in Snellius 402.
The speaker for this meeting is I-Fan Lin. I-Fan started the master in Statistical Science at Leiden University in 2019. 
Next to being a teaching assistant for the course ‘Bayesian Statistics’, he is currently finishing his master’s project supervised by none other than Amine Hadji.

"Gaussian Processes (GP) are widely used for inference for nonparametric regression and classification. However, their computational complexity scales cubicly with the sample size rendering them unfeasible for large data sets. To speed up the computations various distributed methods were proposed in the literature. Among these distributed methods, it is possible to distinguish averaging methods and spatial methods. We propose a comparative simulation study of a selection of these methods in the context of both nonparametric regression and classification. We will be focusing on recovery and uncertainty quantification."
