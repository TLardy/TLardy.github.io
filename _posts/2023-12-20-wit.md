Relational events are defined as the temporal occurrence of some network feature, such as time-stamped dyadic link (s,r,t) between a sender s and receiver r (in case of a personal email), or a time-stamped link (s,R,t) between a sender and a set of receivers R (in the case of spam), or the occurrence of an hyperedge (h,t), where h is a subset of vertices. Since their introduction in 2008, relational event models have been used to describe a variety of processes, from communication networks to hospital transfer networks. Recently, case-control sampling techniques have also allowed modelling large networks efficiently.
In this talk, we show that the idea of case-control sampling can be further extended to extend the relational event model to also include random effects, additive components and goodness-of-fit diagnostics.  We apply these extensions for analysing patterns of the spread of alien species around the globe between 1880 and 2005, following accidental or deliberate introductions into geographical regions outside of their native range.
