<em>
With prostate cancer being the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men worldwide, second in mortality and incidence only rising, this type of cancer is a substantial contributor to the cancer-related burden of disease. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a pivotal biomarker in prostate cancer research, due to its high sensitivity and measurements being non-invasive. PSA has been researched mostly in diagnostic and recurrence settings, with less focus on its prognostic value. With this study we aimed to investigate the prognostic and predictive value of PSA in a metastatic prostate cancer population by exploring the relationship between PSA trajectories and no-longer clinical benefit (NLCB). NLCB describes the situation of progression where treatment is no longer effective. To quantify the prognostic value of PSA, different joint model specifications were explored. Two landmark approaches, consisting of last observation carried forward and penalized regression calibration models, were additionally considered for prediction. Data from the ProBio trial (Karolinska Institute, Sweden) – an international, phase-3 platform trial which aims to study novel treatments for metastatic prostate cancer – was used.
