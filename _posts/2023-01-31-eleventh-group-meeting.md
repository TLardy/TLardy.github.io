title: "Learning star shaped distributions: a mixed approach (Eva Riccomagno)" 
---

The eleventh statistics group meeting will take place on Tuesday Jan. 31st from 12:30-13:30 in Snellius 176. 
We will be joined by prof. dr. Eva Riccomagno from the department of Mathematics at the University of Genova:

<em>
"We present a construction of probability density functions
supported on closed and bounded star domains, with concentric isodensity
sets. The construction exploits tools from numerical computational
algebra. The contribution includes an application to classication theory,
for star-shaped clusters."
</em>
