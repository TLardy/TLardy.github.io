title: "Continuous time control charts: detecting changes in the quality of care (Daniel Gomon, MSc)"
---

The third statistics group meeting will be held on Tuesday 26/04 from 13.00 to 14.00 in Snellius 402.
The speaker for this meeting is <a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/daniel-gomon#tab-1" target="_blank">Daniel Gomon</a>.
Daniel started his PhD at Leiden University in 2021, continuing the research he did for his Master's project on continuous time control charts. 
This work won him the prize of <a href="https://platformwiskunde.nl/msc-thesisprijs/" target="_blank">'Best Thesis in Applied Math Award 2021'</a> awarded by Platform Wiskunde Nederland. 
He will delight us with a modified version of the talk that impressed the judges:

<em>
"Rapidly detecting problems in the quality of care is of utmost importance for the well-being of patients. Without proper inspection schemes, such problems can go undetected for years. Cumulative sum (CUSUM) charts have proven to be useful for quality control, yet available methodology for survival outcomes is limited. The few available continuous time inspection charts usually require the researcher to specify an expected increase in the failure rate in advance, thereby requiring prior knowledge about the problem at hand.  Misspecifying parameters can lead to false positive alerts and large detection delays. To solve this problem, we take a more general approach to derive the new CGR-CUSUM chart. We find an expression for the approximate average run length (average time to detection) and illustrate the possible gain in detection speed by using the CGR-CUSUM over the funnel plot, Bernoulli CUSUM and Biswas & Kalbfleisch (2008) CUSUM on a real-life data set from the Dutch Arthroplasty Register as well as in simulation studies. Besides the inspection of medical procedures, the CGR-CUSUM can also be used for other real time inspection schemes such as industrial production lines and quality control of services."
