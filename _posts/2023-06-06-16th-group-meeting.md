title: "Dynamic prediction of survival with many longitudinal predictors: an empirical evaluation (Sophie Retif)"
---

The sixteenth statistics group meeting will take place on 06/06 from 15:00-16:00 in Snellius 176.
Sophie Retif will tell us about the research she has done for her master's thesis while visiting from Politecnico di Milano.

<em>
Collecting longitudinal information on the health of patients has become more and more common. Such information can be used to monitor disease progression, and it can thus play a crucial role for the (dynamic) prediction of survival outcomes. However, until recently there was a lack of methods that could handle many longitudinal covariates as predictors of survival. Over the last 5 years, several methods that make it possible to incorporate information from many longitudinal covariates into dynamic prediction models have been proposed, including MFPCCox (Li et al., 2019), Penalized Regression Calibration (Signorelli et al., 2021), functional survival forests (Lin et al., 2021) and DynForest (Devaux et al., 2023). These approaches differ in terms of how they model the longitudinal covariatesâ€™ evolution over time, and how they model the relationship between the longitudinal covariates and the survival outcome. Because these methods are fairly new, to date little is known about their advantages and limitations, as well as about their performance with real-world data. In this talk we will first provide an overview of the aforementioned methods, focusing in particular on the different strategies that they use to model and summarize disease progression. Then, we will present the results of a systematic comparison of the predictive performance of these methods using three real-world datasets that differ in terms of disease type, sample size, number of longitudinal covariates, and length of the follow-up.
