title: Depth conditioned functional curves (Alexander Dürre)
---

The eighth statistics group meeting will take place on Tuesday Nov. 1st from 12:30-13:30 in Snellius 176. 
Alexander Dürre, the newest addition to the statistics group, will introduce us to some of his work:

<em>
"Statistical functionals are useful tools to extract essential informations like location, scale or dependence from possibly complicated distributions. Popular examples are the expected value, the variance and the covariance matrix. A major appeal lies in their simplicity, which is also their major limitation. Sometimes the location of a distribution cannot be solely described by its expectation. Imagine a mixture distribution of a standard normal with large mixture weight and a point mass in μ far a way from 0. The expectation then lies between 0 and μ, failing to capture neither the location of the standard normal nor the location of the ”outlying” probability mass. We will develop the idea of conditional functional curves which capture both the properties of the central probability mass and properties of the outer or outlying probability mass.
To do so, we characterize outlyingness by a depth function D. That is a function which assigns every possible value of random variable X a positive number. The smaller the number the more we think that this value is an outlier. Now we can compute a functional, say the mean, conditional that the depth function attains some value d. Repeating this for all possible d gives use the depth conditioned functional curve which describes properties of the central probability mass for large d, respectively properties of the ”outlying” probability mass for small d. We derive a pointwise consistent estimator for the depth conditioned functional curve and show its asymptotic normality. We conclude with some examples underlining the various possibilities to apply this method."
