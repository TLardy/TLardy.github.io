Many relationships in causality, statistics or probability theory can be expressed as conditional independence relations between the occurring random variables. Since the invention of the notion of conditional independence one aim was to be able to also express such relationship between random and non-random variables, like the parameters of a stochastic model, the input variables of a probabilistic program or intervention variables in a causal model. Over time several different versions of such extended conditional independence notion have been proposed, each coming with their own advantages and disadvantages, oftentimes limited to certain subclasses of random variables like discrete variables or ones with densities.
n this talk we present another such notion of conditional independence, which can easily be expressed in measure-theoretic generality and even in categorical probability. We will study its expressivity, present its (convenient) properties, and relate it to other notions of conditional independence.
