title: "Student mobility: A network approach to discover chain migration patterns in higher education"
---

This talk will be given by Vincenzo Giuseppe Genova from the University of Palermo:

<em>
"Educational mobility plays a role in the development of a country. Indeed, it implies an exchange of socioeconomic opportunities and expertise among countries. When these movements are not symmetric and the balance is negative for a particular region, socioeconomic problems can arise. An example of one-way migration is Italian student mobility, where students move from the South to the Center-North (30% in 2017). In this talk, we explore student mobility from Sicily towards universities in the mainland, invoking the paradigm of chain migration in demography. Studies on this topic are very few in the literature and are mainly based on qualitative methods. We developed data analysis tools at the verge of Network Theory to identify preferential mobility patterns starting from micro-data of a mobility network and applied these methods to reveal preferential patterns of mobility of Sicilian students. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time the concept of chain migration, within the frame of the network analysis, has been applied to study the Italian studentsâ€™ mobility."
