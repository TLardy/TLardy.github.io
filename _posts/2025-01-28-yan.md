<em>
Probability limit theory for independent random variables has produced many significant results. However, in practical applications, the assumption of independence among variables is often difficult to satisfy. Therefore, the study of the limiting behaviour of dependent random variables is of great significance. This research focuses on the limiting behaviour of maximum of randomly weighted sums for a sequence of random variables that satisfy WOD structure. The findings extended existing theoretical results. Based on the obtained results, the Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund type strong law of large numbers is established, and the strong consistency of estimators in certain statistical models is proved. To support the theoretical results, the simulation work to verify the validity of the theoretical results is also conducted.
