title: Second Statistics Group Meeting (prof. Peter Grünwald)
---

The second statistics group meeting will be held Tuesday 22/03 from 13.00 to 14.00 in Snellius 401. 
The speaker for this meeting is <a href="http://www.grunwald.nl" target="_blank">Prof. dr. P. Grünwald</a>.
Peter is head of the machine learning group at CWI in Amsterdam and has been professor at Leiden University since 2008. 
Currently, much of his work is focussed on hypothesis tests that are safe under optional stopping and continuation. 
His talk ‘E is for Evidence’ will give an introduction to this world of safe testing. 
A brief appetizer:

<em>
“How much evidence do the data give us about one hypothesis versus  another?
The standard way to measure evidence is still the p-value,  despite a myriad of problems surrounding it. One central such problem is  its inability to deal with optional stopping, combining evidence of separate studies  and its dependence on  unknowable counterfactuals. We introduce the E-value, a notion of  evidence which overcomes these issues. When both hypotheses are simple,  the E-value is a likelihood ratio. When there is a null hypothesis  and it is simple, the E-value coincides with the Bayes factor, the  notion of evidence preferred by Bayesians. But when both hypotheses are  composite, or an alternative cannot be explicitly formulated, E-values and Bayes  factors become distinct. Unlike the Bayes factor, E-values allow for  tests with strict Type-I error control. They are also the basic building blocks of anytime-valid confidence intervals that - unlike standard CIs - remain valid under optional stopping. E-values and test martingales (their running products) have a long history, but were largely unknown until three years ago -when suddenly a plethora of new results were published by a variety of researchers.
